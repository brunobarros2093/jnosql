/**
 * This package contains all objects to use a Semi-Structured API. This API focuses on handling semi-structured data,
 * providing functionality to work with data that does not adhere strictly to a predefined schema.
 * Semi-structured data is characterized by its flexibility, allowing for variations in data structure
 * within the same dataset.
 * In the context of NoSQL databases, semi-structured data often includes documents, JSON, XML, or other formats
 * where the data may have nested or variable fields.
 * This package provides utilities and interfaces to interact with semi-structured data sources, allowing for
 * storage, retrieval, and manipulation of such data in a flexible and efficient manner.
