/**
 * This exception class represents an exception related to metadata operations in the context of a NoSQL database.
 * It extends the {@link NoSQLException} class and is used to signal errors that occur during metadata-related operations,
 * such as schema management or entity mapping.
 *
 * <p>The {@code } provides constructors for creating instances with different levels of detail,
 * including specifying custom messages and associated causes. It inherits constructors from its superclass,
 * {@link NoSQLException}, allowing for flexible exception handling and propagation of error information.
 *
 * <p>This exception typically occurs when there are issues with handling or processing metadata information,
 * such as during database schema initialization, entity mapping, or other metadata-related tasks.
 * Developers can catch instances of this exception to handle metadata-related errors gracefully,
 * potentially taking corrective actions or providing more informative error messages to users.
 *
 * <p>When using the {@code MetadataException}, it's recommended to consult the relevant documentation of the
 * NoSQL database or data mapping framework being used to understand the specific scenarios in which this
 * exception may be thrown and the appropriate ways to handle it.
